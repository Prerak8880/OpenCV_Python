# Gaussian Blurring

--> In OpenCV, the cv2.GaussianBlur function is frequently used for applying Gaussian blurring to an image.
--> It takes as input the image and the size of the kernel (specified by the standard deviation of the Gaussian distribution).
--> Adjusting the kernel size allows you to control the amount of blurring applied to the image.
